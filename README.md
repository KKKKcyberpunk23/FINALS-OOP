## Carwash Management System
**Carwash Management System** – A console-based Java application to manage vehicle transactions, daily summaries, and service pricing for a carwash business.

---

## Description / Overview
This project is a **Java-based Carwash Management System** designed to help carwash businesses track customer vehicles, manage daily transactions, and calculate revenues efficiently.  
Key features include:

- Add and edit customer vehicle transactions.
- View all daily transactions and summary reports.
- Supports multiple vehicle types: Car, Motorcycle, Van, and Custom vehicles.
- Pricing information and service options.
- Saves transactions and summaries to text files for persistence.

It solves the problem of **manual record-keeping** and helps automate reporting and pricing calculations.

### Helper Classes
| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `Vehicle` | Base class for all vehicle types. |
| `Car` | Represents a car, calculates pricing and displays summary. |
| `Motorcycle` | Represents motorcycles/tricycles, includes sidecar option. |
| `Van` | Represents vans, handles pricing and summary. |
| `Custom` | Represents unique/custom vehicles with negotiated price. |
| `FileHandler` | Handles saving and loading transactions and summaries. |
| `PriceInfo` | Displays pricing tables for services. |

## Key Features
### 1. Add Customer Vehicle
Register a new vehicle with customizable details. Supported types:

    Car (SML / MED / LRGE)
    Motorcycle / Tricycle (with optional sidecar)
    Van
    Custom Vehicle (unique name + user-defined price)
    Available services:
    
    Regular Carwash
    Carwash w/ Buffing Wax
    Engine Wash (not available for motorcycles)

### 2. Edit Existing Transactions

Modify any saved transaction:

    Update brand
    Update color
    Change service (auto recalculates price)
    The system provides a live preview of all updated information.

3. Show All Transactions

Displays all transactions for the current day in a formatted table showing:

    Vehicle
    Brand
    Color
    Service
    Price

    Automatically saved to:
    transactions.txt

4. Daily Summary & Report

Generates a complete daily performance summary:

    Vehicle counts (Car, Motorcycle, Van, Custom)
    Service counts (Carwash, Buffing Wax, Engine Wash)
    Total Revenue
    Total Transactions
    Saved automatically to:
    dataSummary.txt

5. Price Information

Provides the full pricing breakdown for:

    Cars (size-based pricing)
    Motorcycles / Tricycles
    Vans

    Custom vehicles
    Includes all service-based price adjustments.

6. File Handling Integration

The system automatically:

    Loads today’s previous transactions
    Saves every update instantly
    Generates and stores daily summaries for record-keeping

## 3. OOP Concepts Applied
The project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles as follows:
```
┌───────────────────┐
│    Vehicle        │  ← Abstract Class (Abstraction)
│------------------│
│ - brand           │  ← Encapsulation
│ - color           │  ← Encapsulation
│ - serviceChoices  │  ← Encapsulation
│------------------│
│ + getBrand()      │
│ + setBrand()      │
│ + getColor()      │
│ + setColor()      │
│ + getService()    │
│ + setService()    │
│ + displaySummary()│  ← Abstract Method
└────────┬─────────┘
│
┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
│               │               │
┌─────────┐     ┌────────────┐   ┌────────┐
│   Car   │     │ Motorcycle │   │  Van   │
│---------│     │------------│   │--------│
│ + size  │     │ + hasSideCars │ │        │
│ + price │     │ + price      │   │ + price│
│---------│     │------------│   │--------│
│ + displaySummary() │ + displaySummary() │ + displaySummary() │
└─────────┘     └────────────┘   └────────┘
│
│
┌─────────┐
│  Custom │
│---------│
│ + vehicle │
│ + price   │
│ + displaySummary() │
└─────────┘
```
### 3.1 Inheritance
- `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Van`, and `Custom` classes inherit from the **`Vehicle`** base class.
- Shared properties like `brand`, `color`, and `service` are defined in `Vehicle`.
```
public class Car extends Vehicle { ... }
public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle { ... }
public class Van extends Vehicle { ... }
public class Custom extends Vehicle { ... }
```

### 3.2 Polymorphism
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: `Vehicle vehicles = new Car(...)` allows different types of vehicles to be handled uniformly.
- Methods like `displaySummary()` are overridden in subclasses for vehicle-specific behavior.
```
        Vehicle vehicles;

switch(vehicleChoice){
    case "1" -> vehicles = new Car(brand, color, size, serviceChoices);
    case "2" -> vehicles = new Motorcycle(brand, color, hasSideCars, serviceChoices);
    case "3" -> vehicles = new Van(brand, color, serviceChoices);
    case "4" -> vehicles = new Custom(brand, color, price, uniqueVehicle, serviceChoices);
}

dailyRecords.get(today).add(vehicles);
vehicles.displaySummary(); // METHOD OVERRIDING – different output for Car, Motorcycle, Van, Custom

```
### 3.3 Encapsulation
- Fields such as `brand`, `color`, and `price` are private with public getter and setter methods.
- Ensures proper control over how data is accessed and modified.
```
protected String brand;
protected String color;
protected String serviceChoices;

String getBrand() { return this.brand; }
void setBrand(String brand) { this.brand = brand; }

String getColor() { return this.color; }
void setColor(String color) { this.color = color; }

void setService(String serviceChoices) { this.serviceChoices = serviceChoices; }

```

### 3.4 Abstraction
- The `Vehicle` class serves as an abstract blueprint for different vehicle types.
- Users interact with higher-level methods without worrying about subclass implementations.
```
public abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    protected String color;
    protected String serviceChoices;

    Vehicle(String brand, String color, String serviceChoices) { ... }

    abstract void displaySummary(); // abstract method
}

```

## Future Enhancements
While the current system provides core functionalities for managing vehicle transactions efficiently, there are several potential improvements that could be implemented in future versions:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Transition from a console-based system to a user-friendly GUI to enhance usability and accessibility.
- **Database Integration:** Replace text file storage with a robust database system to improve data management, scalability, and query efficiency.
- **Advanced Reporting:** Include dynamic reports, charts, and statistics for better insights into daily, weekly, and monthly transactions.
- **Online Booking and Payment:** Integrate online booking and payment functionalities to streamline customer experience.
